# There will be proper documentation here at some point. Promise.

But for now, there are three sections to this repo:

1. K8Sdeployments - simple examples off stuff I use when I need some application to run.
2. TFdeployments - each folder is different Terraform deployment for infrastructure.
3. TFmodules - various modules used by the deployments in the other folder.
